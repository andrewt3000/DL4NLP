## Word Vectors
Resources about word vectors, aka word embeddings, and distributed representations for words.  
Word vectors are numeric representations of words that are often used as input to deep learning systems. This process is sometimes called pretraining.

[Mikolov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oBu8kMMAAAAJ&hl=en) et al. 2013.  
Generate word and phrase vectors.  Performs well on word similarity and analogy task and includes [Word2Vec source code](https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/)  Subsamples frequent words. (i.e. frequent words like "the" are skipped periodically to speed things up and improve vector for less frequently used words)
