## Word Vectors
Resources about word vectors, aka word embeddings, and distributed representations for words.  
Word vectors are numeric representations of words where similar words have similar vectors. Word vectors are often used as input to deep learning systems. This process is sometimes called pretraining.

timesteps, thereby achieving strong performance in many text classification tasks, such as IMDB, DBpedia and 20 Newsgroups."

Implements attention mechanism. "Each time the proposed model generates a word in a translation, it
(soft-)searches for a set of positions in a source sentence where the most relevant information is
concentrated"  
Result: "comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation."

Jean, Cho, Memisevic, Bengio 2014.    
"we try replacing each [UNK] token with the aligned source word or its most likely translation determined by another word alignment model."  
Result: English -> German bleu score = 21.59 (target vocabulary of 50,000)

Machine Translation](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.00578v1.pdf)  
Choi, Cho, Bengio 2016  
"we propose to contextualize the word embedding vectors using a nonlinear bag-of-words representation of the source sentence."  
"we propose to represent special tokens (such as numbers, proper nouns and acronyms) with typed symbols to facilitate translating those words that are not well-suited to be translated via continuous vectors."

Uses [seq2seq framework](http://tensorflow.org/tutorials/seq2seq/index.html).  Seq2Seq was originally designed for machine translation and it "translates" a single sentence, up to around 79 words, to a single sentence response, and has no memory of previous dialog exchanges.

[Adversarial Learning for Neural Dialogue Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06547)  
Li et al. 2017  
"We cast the task as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem where we jointly train two systems, a generative model to produce response sequences, and a discriminator—analagous to the human evaluator in the Turing test— to distinguish between the human-generated dialogues and the machine-generated ones. The outputs from the discriminator are then used as rewards for the generative model"
They use REINFORCE algorithm (Williams 1992). They refine using Reward for Every Generation Step (REGS) which breaks up the response and gives rewards for the words individually rather than a single value. They also use "Teacher Forcing" to stablize the GAN, which provides a correct (human) response to train incorrect examples. Minimum nunber of words in response is 5.

## Memory and Attention Models
Attention mechanisms allows the network to refer back to the input sequence, instead of forcing it to encode all information into one fixed-length vector.  - [Attention and Memory in Deep Learning and NLP](http://www.opendatascience.com/blog/attention-and-memory-in-deep-learning-and-nlp/)

[Neural Turing Machines](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.5401v2.pdf)  
Graves, Wayne, Danihelka 2014.  
We extend the capabilities of neural networks by coupling them to external memory resources, which they can interact with by attentional processes. The combined system is analogous to a Turing Machine or Von Neumann architecture but is differentiable end-toend, allowing it to be efficiently trained with gradient descent. Preliminary results demonstrate
that Neural Turing Machines can infer simple algorithms such as copying, sorting, and associative recall from input and output examples.
